Variable Notes:
 
- Numerica data types:

Both types "double" and "float" can be classified as "floating point numbers". What a floating point number is: anything with a fractional part.

For example:
5.4 6.8 3.0

Floating point:
The difference between the double type and the float type is precision. Think of precision as "How much data the variable can hold".

For example:
If we had the value 99.999999. This value is super precise. 

Double type:

Double data types are more standard. If you pass any float data types to the placeholders %i and %f inside the printf() function, the printf() function would convert the float value to a double data type. This is why we mentioned earlier that double data type are more standard. 

FYI: When we use double data type, it would take up twice the space. This applies for a device with limited memory. 

c functions:

- scanf():
When we scanf in floating point values we use the placeholder %lf. This is how we scanf() a double. The %lf format character can be used to read scientific notation and decimal notation.
